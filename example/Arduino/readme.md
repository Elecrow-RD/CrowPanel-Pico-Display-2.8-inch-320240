# Library Descriptions

## Adafruit_BusIO
Adafruit_BusIO is a library that provides a common interface for communicating with I2C, SPI, and other bus protocols on microcontrollers like the Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Adafruit_GFX_Library
The Adafruit GFX Library is a graphics library that simplifies drawing shapes, text, and images on displays connected to microcontrollers.

## Adafruit_seesaw_Library
The Adafruit seesaw Library allows you to communicate with Adafruit's seesaw devices, which can add additional functionality such as capacitive touch sensing or analog-to-digital conversion to your projects.

## Adafruit_ST7735_and_ST7789_Library
This library supports driving ST7735 and ST7789 LCD displays, commonly used in small-sized color displays for embedded systems.

## DHT20
The DHT20 library interfaces with the DHT20 digital temperature and humidity sensor, providing functions to read environmental data.

## GFX_Library_for_Arduino
This is likely another graphics library similar to Adafruit GFX, tailored specifically for Arduino compatibility but may also work with other platforms.

## GUISlice
GUISlice is a GUI library that helps create graphical user interfaces with buttons, sliders, and other widgets for microcontroller projects.

## lvgl
LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) is an open-source graphics library that enables developers to create complex GUIs with high performance and low resource usage.

## TFT_eSPI
TFT_eSPI is a library for driving TFT displays via the SPI protocol, often used with ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers but can
